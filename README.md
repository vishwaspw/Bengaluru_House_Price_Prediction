# Bengaluru House Price Prediction

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict house prices in Bangalore based on factors like location, square footage, and the number of rooms. The model training and prediction are completed within a Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview

This notebook builds a predictive model for estimating house prices in Bangalore. It leverages data such as property location, square footage, BHK (bedrooms, hall, kitchen), and bathrooms to forecast prices, providing insights for homebuyers and real estate professionals.

## Dataset
- **Dataset_used**:open `Bengaluru_House_Data.xls`
- **Location**: Bangalore
- **Features**: 
  - Total square footage
  - BHK (bedrooms, hall, kitchen)
  - Bathrooms
  - Location
- **Target**: House price (in Lakhs)

## Requirements

Install the necessary packages with the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. **Open the Notebook**: Launch the Jupyter Notebook and open `Bengaluru_house_price_prediction.ipynb`.
2. **Run the Cells**: Execute each cell step-by-step to load data, preprocess it, train the model, and evaluate performance.
3. **Predict Prices**: Use the trained model to predict prices by running the final cell.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-Learn** for model building and evaluation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualization
